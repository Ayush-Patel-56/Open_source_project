# Crop Recommendation & Weather Insights Platform

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This is the codebase for the **Crop Recommendation & Weather Insights Platform** — a full-stack application designed to help farmers and agritech stakeholders by combining (1) crop-recommendation intelligence and (2) weather & field-insights dashboards.  
The system enables users to:  
- Receive **crop suggestions** based on soil parameters, weather forecasts and historical data.  
- View **weather and environmental insights** (e.g., temperature, rainfall, humidity, heat-stress) tailored to their region.  
- Manage farms, fields, crop-cycles through a clean UI + robust backend API.  
- Support decision-making and improve yields via data-driven agriculture.

## 🗂 Architecture Overview  
### Front-end  
The `agriplatform/` folder houses the user interface (React, Angular, Vue — replace with your choice) that consumes our backend API and presents the dashboards, forms, charts and maps.

### Back-end / API  
- `server.js` (or your entrypoint) sets up the web server (Express.js) and mounts API routes.  
- Routes live under e.g. `routes/` or inline in `server.js`:  
  - **Auth** endpoints (`/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, etc.)  
  - **Farm/Field** endpoints (`/api/farms`, `/api/fields`, etc.)  
  - **Crop-Recommendation** endpoints (`/api/crop-recommendation`)  
  - **Weather/Insights** endpoints (`/api/weather`, `/api/insights`)  
- Middleware for authentication, authorization, validation, error-handling.  
- Database layer (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc) under `models/` or via ORM.

### External Services & Integrations  
- Weather API (e.g., for forecasting, past data) to power weather-insights.  
- Soil / environmental sensor data ingestion (optional).  
- Machine-learning model/component (or rule-engine) that runs crop-recommendation logic.  
- Deployment environment: Node.js server + managed DB + static hosting for front-end.

## 🧰 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js (version >= 14)  
- npm or yarn  
- A running database instance (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)  
- (Optional) API key(s) for weather service(s)

### Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayush-Patel-56/Open_source_project.git
   cd Open_source_project
